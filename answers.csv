1; False; Your hypothesis space is a subset of the version space.; 0
2; False; The target concept might not be represented by the hypothesis space.; 1
3; False; The boosting algorithm can overfit if one of its base learners overfits.; 1
3; True; The boosting algorithm tends not to overfit because it is a linear combination of many weak learners.; 1
4; True; Bayesian Networks can represent AND, OR and XOR.; 1
4; True; Bayesian Networks can represent boolean variables since a boolean variable has a 0-1 distribution.; 1
5; True; As the amount of training data increases, the probability that the model overfits the training data increases. This will cause the training error to go down.; 1
6; False; If the training data is noisy, a classifier trained on it could still overfit.; 1
7; False; Boosting actually can have a lot of variance because it is a combination of many classifiers.; 0
