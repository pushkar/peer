1; Version space is a subset of your hypothesis space.
2; The target concept is an element of your hypothesis space.
3; One of the powerful advantages of the boosting algorithm is that it does not overfit.
4; Bayesian Networks can represent any propositional statement (i.e., boolean symbols and operators).
5; As the amount of training data increases, the training error goes down
6; A classifier trained on less training data is less likely to overfit.
7; Boosting is used to reduce the bias of low-variance classifiers.
