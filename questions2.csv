1;If implemented properly, k-means must converge after a finite number of iterations.
2;If implemented properly, EM must converge after a finite number of iterations.
3;The component features obtained from ICA are orthonormal to each other.
4;For a clustering algorithm, scale invariance means that it should produce the same clustering for a distance matrix and any positive multiple of the same distance matrix. Scale invariance can be achieved by a single-link clustering algorithm that terminates when the number of clusters equals half the number of objects.
5;If you have weakly relevant features in your dataset, you can convert them to strongly relevant features using PCA or ICA.
6;If you have a feature in your dataset which has a constant value for all rows, you should discard it.
7;The No Free Lunch Theorem states that no search algorithm performs better than another search algorithm for all problems.
8;KL Divergence is the measure of the difference between two distributions.
