<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u.data">u.data</a>     -- The full u data set, 100000 ratings by 943 users on 1682 items.
              Each user has rated at least 20 movies.  Users and items are
              numbered consecutively from 1.  The data is randomly
              ordered. This is a tab separated list of
	         user id | item id | rating | timestamp.
              The time stamps are unix seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u.info">u.info</a>     -- The number of users, items, and ratings in the u data set.

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u.item">u.item</a>     -- Information about the items (movies); this is a tab separated
              list of
              movie id | movie title | release date | video release date |

              The last 19 fields are the genres, a 1 indicates the movie
              is of that genre, a 0 indicates it is not; movies can be in
              several genres at once.
              The movie ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u.genre">u.genre</a>    -- A list of the genres.

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u.user">u.user</a>     -- Demographic information about the users; this is a tab

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u1.test">u1.test</a>       are 80%/20% splits of the u data into training and test data.
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u2.base">u2.base</a>       Each of u1, ..., u5 have disjoint test sets; this if for
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u2.test">u2.test</a>       5 fold cross validation (where you repeat your experiment
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u3.base">u3.base</a>       with each training and test set and average the results).
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u3.test">u3.test</a>       These data sets can be generated from u.data by mku.sh.
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u4.base">u4.base</a>

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pushkar/mmovielens/master/u.test">u.test</a>     -- Your test data for which you need to predict ratings. It is
              comma-seperated as opposted to tab-seperated.
