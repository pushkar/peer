    <p>This Peer Feedback website is experimental, in the sense that we are trying out various ways to give you feedback. This page will give you details on this.</p>

    <!--
    <h4>Learning Records</h4>
    <p>Two new sections have been added on the website: in your <a href="{% url 'student:profile' %}">profile</a> page and review pages. Everyone who is taking this course weaves their own way through it. I will attempt to give feedback based on your goals after considering how you did on your exam and assignments. You can read more about how the real <a href="http://www.learningrecord.org/contents.html">learning records</a> worked when it was first tried in schools in London and California.</p>
    <p>The current setup I have on the website is elementary, but we will see how it goes. For now, fill out your profiles. Update your profile with your goals for this course and how well you think you are competent in each of the topics in the Learning Records section.</p>
    <p>Your will also be asked to judge competency for each of these topics for all the submissions you are reviewing. I will use all this information to give you feedback.</p>
    <p>You will get some feedback from me after the next assignment is graded.</p>

    <h4>Updates</h4>

    <h4>Feedback</h4>
    <p>If you have any questions or feedback, email Pushkar Kolhe (pushkar@cc.gatech.edu) or leave a message on Piazza (please tag it with "peer review website"). </p>
